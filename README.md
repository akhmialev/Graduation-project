Graduation project.

1. Django application, a blog to which it will be possible to add posts through the admin panel

2. Make posts pagination

3. Add registration on the site

4. Add the ability to comment on posts by registered users

Important! Frontend can be used third-party. HTML templates can be selected from many sites, but it is important to pay attention to the license and use only with an open license.

Also, the application should look neat, and not contain glitches.
Critical and blocking bugs do not count.
